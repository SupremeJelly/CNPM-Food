- **Eureka Service Discovery**: Allows services to find and communicate with each other without hard-coding hostname and port.
- **User Service**: Manages user accounts and authentication.
- **Restaurant Service**: Handles restaurant information and menus.
- **Order Service**: Processes and manages customer orders.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users about their orders.
- **Frontend**: Angular-based user interface for customers to interact with the system.
